Sean's a child of God,
an ordinary guy saved by Jesus' extraordinary grace.
That's the most important fact to know.

He's also a self-described computer geek and gadget freak,
but that's less important.
He grew up in Seattle, lived in the U.S. for most of his life,
and now lives in the Vancouver, BC area.

He taught computing science, mathematics, and statistics
for seven years at Trinity Western University in Langley, BC.
He's now a freelance statistical consultant doing
data analysis and predictive modelling.

Sean and his wife have been homeschooling their son from
kindergarten through middle school, and enjoy spending
a lot of time together!
