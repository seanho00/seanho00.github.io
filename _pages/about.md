Sean's a child of God,
an ordinary guy saved by Jesus' extraordinary grace.
That's the most important fact to know.

He's also a self-described computer geek and gadget freak,
but that's less important.
He grew up in Seattle, lived in the U.S. for most of his life,
and now lives in the Vancouver, BC area.

He taught computing science, mathematics, and statistics
for seven years at Trinity Western University in Langley, BC.
He's now a freelance statistical consultant doing
data analysis and predictive modelling.

Sean has a beautiful sweetie wifey 
with whom he is insanely lovey-dovey,
and God has blessed them both with 
a wonderful little boy who is teaching
them just how little sleep they need to survive!
